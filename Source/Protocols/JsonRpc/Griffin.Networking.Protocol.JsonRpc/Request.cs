A Request object that is a Notification signifies the Client's lack of interest in the corresponding Response object, and as such no Response object needs to be returned to the client. The Server MUST NOT reply to a Notification, including those that are within a batch request.</para> <para>Notifications are not confirmable by definition, since they do not have a Response object to be returned. As such, the Client would not be aware of any errors (like e.g. "Invalid params.","Internal error.").</para>

The value SHOULD normally not be Null [1] and Numbers SHOULD NOT contain fractional parts [2].</para> <para>The Server MUST reply with the same value in the Response object if included. This member is used to correlate the context between the two objects.</para> <para>[1] The use of Null as a value for the id member in a Request object is discouraged, because this specification uses a value of Null for Responses with an unknown id. Also, because JSON-RPC 1.0 uses an id value of Null for Notifications this could cause confusion in handling.</para> <para>[2] Fractional parts may be problematic, since many decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions.</para>
